\title{Compute the Lindley process from a vector of scores}
\usage{
lindley(scores)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{Numeric vector of per-marker scores
\eqn{X_m = -\log_{10}(p_m) - \xi}. Positive values represent markers with
evidence stronger than the cut-off \eqn{10^{-\xi}}; negative values
accumulate evidence against association.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of the same length as \code{scores}, giving the Lindley
process values \eqn{h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_M} (all \eqn{\ge 0}). The
\strong{local score} is \code{max(lindley(scores))}.
}
\description{
Walks along a vector of per-marker scores and computes the Lindley (running
maximum) process, which forms the basis of the local score statistic.
}
\details{
Implements the Mercier & Daudin (2001) recurrence:
\deqn{h_0 = 0, \quad h_m = \max(0,\; h_{m-1} + X_m).}
The process is non-negative by construction: whenever cumulative evidence
drops below zero, the process resets, beginning a new potential excursion.
Consecutive positions where \eqn{h_m > t} (threshold \eqn{t}) constitute an
\emph{excursion interval} corresponding to a genomic association peak.

\examples{
scores <- c(0.5, -0.3, 0.8, -1.0, 0.2, 0.3)
lindley(scores)
# [1] 0.5 0.2 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.5
max(lindley(scores))  # local score = 1.0
