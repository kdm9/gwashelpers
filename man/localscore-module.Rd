\title{Local Score / Lindley Process for GWAS}
\description{
Local Score / Lindley Process for GWAS
}
\details{
\subsection{Overview}{

The \strong{local score} method aggregates weak association signals from nearby,
correlated markers along the genome into a single scalar rather than treating
each SNP independently (which ignores LD structure). The \strong{Lindley process}
(a running maximum of a random walk) accumulates signal as it walks along the
chromosome, resetting to zero whenever the cumulative evidence becomes
negative. A genomic region is declared significant when this running total
exceeds a threshold derived from extreme-value (Gumbel) theory.
}

\subsection{Formulae (Fariello et al. 2017, Equations 1-4)}{

\strong{Score per marker} (Eq. 1):
\deqn{X_m = -\log_{10}(p_m) - \xi}
where \eqn{\xi \in \{1,2,3,4\}} controls the p-value cut-off: only markers
with \eqn{p_m < 10^{-\xi}} contribute positively to the process.

\strong{Lindley recurrence} (Eq. 2):
\deqn{h_0 = 0, \quad h_m = \max(0,\; h_{m-1} + X_m)}

\strong{Local score} (Eq. 2):
\deqn{H_M = \max_{1 \le m \le M} h_m}

\strong{Null CDF - Gumbel approximation} (Eq. 3):
\deqn{P(H_M \le x) \approx 1 - \exp\!\bigl(-\exp(a_{M,\rho} + b_{M,\rho}\, x)\bigr)}

\strong{Significance threshold} (Eq. 4):
\deqn{t_{M,\rho,\alpha} \approx \frac{\log(-\log(1-\alpha)) - a_{M,\rho}}{b_{M,\rho}}}

Note: the paper writes \eqn{\log(-\log(\alpha))} where \eqn{\alpha} is
\eqn{1 - \text{FWER}}; the R code uses the equivalent survival-function form
\eqn{\log(-\log(1-\alpha))} where \eqn{\alpha} is the FWER directly.
}

\subsection{Gumbel Parameter Approximation}{

The Gumbel location and scale parameters depend on the number of markers
\eqn{M} and the lag-1 autocorrelation \eqn{\rho} (a proxy for LD):
\deqn{a_{M,\rho} = \log(M) + c_3\rho^3 + c_2\rho^2 + c_1\rho + c_0}
\deqn{b_{M,\rho} = d_2\rho^2 + d_1\rho + d_0}

The polynomial coefficients \eqn{c_i, d_i} were estimated by simulation over
\eqn{M \in [100, 45000]} and \eqn{\rho \in [0, 0.9]} and are tabulated for
\eqn{\xi \in \{1,2,3,4\}} in \code{lindley_thresh()}.
