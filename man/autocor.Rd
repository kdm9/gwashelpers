\title{Compute the absolute lag-1 autocorrelation of a numeric vector}
\usage{
autocor(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector (typically raw p-values from adjacent markers).}
}
\value{
A single non-negative number: the absolute value of the lag-1
Pearson correlation between \code{x[-1]} and \code{x[-length(x)]}. Used as the
LD proxy \eqn{\rho} in \code{lindley_thresh()}.
}
\description{
Compute the absolute lag-1 autocorrelation of a numeric vector
}
\details{
Adjacent markers in LD tend to have correlated association p-values. This
function estimates that correlation as the absolute lag-1 Pearson correlation
of the raw p-value vector — a simple but effective surrogate for \eqn{\rho}.
The absolute value is taken because both positive and negative lag-1
correlations inflate the local score null distribution equally.
