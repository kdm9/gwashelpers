Description: Implements the local score (Lindley process) approach to aggregating
    weak association signals from nearby, correlated markers in genome-wide
    association studies (GWAS). Rather than treating each SNP independently,
    the method accumulates signal along the chromosome and resets to zero when
    cumulative evidence becomes negative, then applies a Gumbel-theory threshold
    to call significance. Methods follow Fariello et al. (2017)
    <doi:10.1111/mec.14141> and Bonhomme et al. (2019)
